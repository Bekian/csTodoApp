## Assorted
- I avoid similar error message wording in program and in taskmanager to try to keep it somewhat clear that they're separate 
> SideNote (sn): ideally i'd make it really clear by making them more functionally distinct like the program.cs uses the taskamanger.cs, but the intent of this project was to learn C# and create a working cli todoapp, not be nitpicky about structure
